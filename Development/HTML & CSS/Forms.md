```html
<form action="example.com/path" method="post">
  <!-- Form content goes here -->
</form>
```

Most common methods are `GET` and `POST` for example, use `GET` on the google search bar form to `GET` the results of the search, and use `POST` to send the billing address of a customer to the backend.

Example of a text input:
```html
<label for="first_name">First Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="first_name" name="first_name">
```
`type` defines what type of input this is.
`<label>` uses `for` to reference which form component `id` this is for.
`placeholder` provides temporary content on the input field.
