#### Universal Selector
```css
* {
  color: white;
}
```

#### Type selectors
```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div>Hello, World!</div>
<div>Hello again!</div>
<p>Hi...</p>
<div>Okay, bye.</div>
```

```css
/* styles.css */

div {
  color: white;
}
```

#### Class selectors
```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div class="alert-text">Please agree to our terms of service.</div>
```

```css
/* styles.css */

.alert-text {
  color: red;
}
```

#### ID Selectors
```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div id="title">My Awesome 90's Page</div>
```

```css
/* styles.css */

#title {
  background-color: red;
}
```

#### Grouping Selectors
###### Before:
```css
.read {
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
  /* several unique declarations */
}

.unread {
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
  /* several unique declarations */
}
```

###### After:
```css
.read,
.unread {
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
}

.read {
  /* several unique declarations */
}

.unread {
  /* several unique declarations */
}
```

#### Chaining selectors
```html
<div>
  <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
  <p class="subsection preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>
</div>
```

```css
.subsection.header {
  color: red;
}
/*Only tags with subsection and header class will have this styling*/
```

This can also be used to chain a class and an ID, as shown below:

```html
<div>
  <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
  <p class="subsection" id="preview">
    This is where a preview for a post might go.
  </p>
</div>
```

You can take the two elements above and combine them with the following:

```css
.subsection.header {
  color: red;
}

.subsection#preview {
  color: blue;
}
```

### Combinators
#### Descendant combinator
```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div class="ancestor">
  <!-- A -->
  <div class="contents">
    <!-- B -->
    <div class="contents"><!-- C --></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="contents"></div>
<!-- D -->
```

```css
/* styles.css */

.ancestor .contents {
  /* some declarations */
}
/*Any tag with class contents that is a child of a tag with class ancestor will have styling applied*/
```

In the above example, the first two elements with theÂ `contents`Â class (B and C) would be selected, but that last element (D) wouldnâ€™t be.

- `>`Â - the child combinator
- `+`Â - the adjacent sibling combinator
- `~`Â - the general sibling combinator

Examples
```html
<main class="parent">
  <div class="child group1">
    <div class="grand-child group1"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="child group2">
    <div class="grand-child group2"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="child group3">
    <div class="grand-child group3"></div>
  </div>
</main>
```

To select all children of parent div we could do below
```css
main div {
  /* Our cool CSS */
}
```

What if we want to specify only divs with class child or class grand-child, use `>` child combinator
```css
/* This rule will only select divs with a class of child */
main > div {
  /* Our cool CSS */
}

/* This rule will only select divs with a class of grand-child */
main > div > div {
  /* More cool CSS */
}
```

n order to select an element that is adjacent to our target, or on the same level of indentation, we can use the adjacent sibling combinatorÂ `+`
```css
/* This rule will only select the div with the class child group2 */
.group1 + div {
  /* Our cool CSS */
}

/* This rule will only select the div with the class child group3 */
.group1 + div + div {
  /* More cool CSS */
}
```

Finally, if we want to select all of an elementâ€™s siblings and not just the first one, we can use the general sibling combinatorÂ `~`.

```css
/* This rule will select all of .group1's siblings - in this case the 2nd and 3rd .child divs */
.group1 ~ div {
  /* Our cool CSS */
}
```


#### Dynamic and user action pseudo-classes
[`:focus`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/f/focus/)Â applies to an element that is currently selected by the user either through selecting it with their cursor or using their keyboard.

[`:hover`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/h/hover/)Â will affect anything under the userâ€™s mouse pointer.Â It can be used to give extra oomph to buttons and links to highlight that theyâ€™re interactable, or to trigger a drop-down menu.

[`:active`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/a/active/)Â applies to elements that are currently being clicked, and is especially useful for giving your user feedback that their action had an effect. This is a great one to give your buttons and other interactive elements more â€˜tactileâ€™ feedback.

Link example
```css
  /* This rule will apply to all links */
  a {
    text-decoration: underline;
  }

  /* This will apply to unvisited links */
  a:link {
    color: blue;
  }

  /* And you guessed it, this applies to all links the user has clicked on */
  a:visited {
    color: purple;
  }
```

#### Structural pseudo-classes

[`:root`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/r/root/)Â is a special class that represents the very top level of your document - the one element that has no parents. Generally when working with the web, this is equivalent to theÂ `html`Â element, but there are aÂ [few subtle differences](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15899615/whats-the-difference-between-css3s-root-pseudo-class-and-html).

`:root`Â is generally the place where you will place your â€˜globalâ€™ CSS rules that you want available everywhere - such as your custom properties and CSS variables, or rules such asÂ `box-sizing: border-box;`.

[`:first-child`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/f/first-child/)Â andÂ [`:last-child`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/l/last-child/)Â will match elements that are the first or last sibling.

Similarly,Â [`:empty`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/e/empty/)Â will match elements that have no children at all, andÂ [`:only-child`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/o/only-child/)Â will match elements that donâ€™t have any siblings.

For a more dynamic approach we can useÂ [`:nth-child`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/n/nth-child/).Â This is a flexible pseudo-class with a few different uses.

```css
  .myList:nth-child(5) {/* Selects the 5th element with class myList */}

  .myList:nth-child(3n) { /* Selects every 3rd element with class myList */}

  .myList:nth-child(3n + 3) { /* Selects every 3rd element with class myList, beginning with the 3rd */}

  .myList:nth-child(even) {/* Selects every even element with class myList */}
```

#### Pseudo-elements

While pseudo-classes give us an alternative way to interact with our HTML elements based on their state or structure, pseudo-elements are more abstract. They allow us to affect parts of our HTML that arenâ€™t elements at all. These special elements share the same specificity as regular elements (0, 0, 0, 1). There are a number of useful pseudo-elements that can be utilized in any number of creative ways.

[`::marker`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/m/marker/)Â allows you to customize the styling of yourÂ `<li>`Â elementsâ€™ bullets or numbers.

[`::first-letter`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/f/first-letter/)Â andÂ [`::first-line`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/f/first-line/)Â allow you to (you guessed it!) give special styling to the first letter or line of some text.

[`::selection`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/s/selection/)Â allows you to change the highlighting when a user selects text on the page.

[`::before`Â andÂ `::after`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/a/after-and-before/)Â allow us to add extra elements onto the page with CSS, instead of HTML. Using it to decorate text in various ways is one common use case.

```html
<style>
  .emojify::before {
    content: 'ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ¥¸ ðŸ¤“';
}

  .emojify::after {
    content: 'ðŸ¤“ ðŸ¥¸ ðŸ˜Ž';
}
</style>

<body>
  <div> Let's <span class="emojify">emojify</span>this span!</div>
</body>
```

#### Attribute selectors

The last tool weâ€™re going to add to the box is attribute selectors. Recall that an attribute is simply anything in the opening tag of an HTML element - such asÂ `src='picture.jpg'`Â orÂ `href="www.theodinproject.com"`.

Since we write our own values for attributes, we need a slightly more flexible system to be able to target specific values.

Attribute selectors have the same specificity as classes and pseudo-classes (0, 0, 1, 0).

Letâ€™s look at some examples for basic usage.

- `[attribute]`Â - This general selector will select anything where the given attribute exists. Its value doesnâ€™t matter.
- `selector[attribute]`Â - Optionally we can combine our attribute selectors with other types of selectors, such as class or element selectors.
- `[attribute="value"]`Â -Â To get really specific, we can useÂ `=`Â to match a specific attribute with a specific value.

```css
  [src] {
    /* This will target any element that has a src attribute. */
  }

  img[src] {
    /* This will only target img elements that have a src attribute. */
  }

  img[src="puppy.jpg"] {
    /* This will target img elements with a src attribute that is exactly "puppy.jpg" */
  }
```

Sometimes we need to be more general in how we access these attributes. For example, perhaps weâ€™re only interested inÂ `img`Â elements where theÂ `src`Â attributeâ€™s value ends inÂ `.jpg`. For cases like this we have some attribute selectors that allow us to match a part of the attributeâ€™s value. If youâ€™ve ever come acrossÂ [regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)Â before, these attributes use a similar syntax.

- `[attribute^="value"]`Â -Â `^=`Â Will match strings from the start.
- `[attribute$="value"]`Â -Â `$=`Â Will match strings from the end.
- `[attribute*="value"]`Â -Â `*=`Â The wildcard selector will match anywhere inside the string.

```css
[class^='aus'] {
  /* Classes are attributes too!
    This will target any class that begins with 'aus':
    class='austria'
    class='australia'
  */
}

[src$='.jpg'] {
  /* This will target any src attribute that ends in '.jpg':
  src='puppy.jpg'
  src='kitten.jpg'
  */
}

[for*='ill'] {
  /* This will target any for attribute that has 'ill' anywhere inside it:
  for="bill"
  for="jill"
  for="silly"
  for="ill"
  */
}
```
