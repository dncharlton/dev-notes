In Git, commands are divided into high-level ("porcelain") commands and low-level ("plumbing") commands. The porcelain commands are the ones that you will use most often as a developer to interact with your code. Some porcelain commands are:

- `git status`
- `git add`
- `git commit`
- `git push`
- `git pull`
- `git log`

Don't worry about what they do yet, we'll cover them in detail soon. Some examples of plumbing commands are:

- `git apply`
- `git commit-tree`
- `git hash-object`
