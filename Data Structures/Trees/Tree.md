A tree is a collection of nodes starting at a root or head node, similar to how our Linked List was a collection of nodes starting with a head (root). The big difference between a LL and a tree is that a tree's nodes can have multiple children instead of just one.

A generic tree structure has the following rules:

- Each node has a value and a list of "children"
- Children can only have a single "parent"
- Duplicate values _are_ allowed, multiple nodes can have the same value
